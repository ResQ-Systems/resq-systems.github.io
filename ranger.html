                    <p>Currently in rapid development, Ranger is
                        envisioned as a pentamotor, tandem-wing
                        drone with VTOL, hover and cruise
                        capabilities, featuring full autonomous
                        control and an inbuilt compute module.</p>
                    <p>Working in tandem with <span class="orange">Ground Station</span>
                        and <span class="orange">Connect</span>, Ranger will operate as
                        autonomously or manually as required,
                        without being needlessly complicated.</p>

                <h1>Vision</h1>
                <p>A drone that can transition from close hover to high cruise effortlessly; a drone that doesn't
                    need to be told where to go; a drone that can investigate its own findings and report back to
                    you autonomously; a drone that can protect itself in dangerous weather; a drone that
                    changes plans on the fly; a drone that takes less time to set up and pack up; a drone that
                    can stay up for an entire search</p>
                    <p>The ResQ vision is a drone that watches, assesses, and guides from start to finish, that
heightens your awareness, has its own senses, and makes its own moves. An intelligent,
rugged workhorse. A vigilant observer.</p>
<p><strong>That's why we called it Ranger.</strong></p>

                    <p>A drone is only as capable as the quality of sensors it can carry; Ranger is no exception.
                        Our
                        suite delivers an optimised, effective balance of quality, weight, and price. Ranger's
                        cameras
                        provide your ground team with birds-eye clarity streamable* directly to their devices via
                        Connect, with the choice of either a <strong>35MP visual payload</strong>, or a
                        <strong>visual / infrared pairing</strong> -
                        granting maximum flexibility and <strong>low-light operability.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p><small>* Ranger's visual suite is expected to provide smooth HD video at 30fps directly to
                            operator devices for manual
                            observation and/or control. In autonomous modes, full quality images from both pure
                            visual +
                            V&IR suites will be

                        allow for <strong>a revolution in drone control and autonomy.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ranger's proprietary, custom compute stack processes and interprets video autonomously.
                        Modern algorithms outpace and outmatch what operators can see in real-time. Able to
                        intelligently and independently plot routes, navigate, identify points of interest, and alert
                        your
                        team to them, Ranger brings with it <strong>an entirely new workflow: letting the drone handle
                            the data </strong> so you can <strong>better move and work on the ground</strong>. In line
                        with Ranger's central
                        vision - to <strong>give you options</strong> - manual operation is naturally always available.
                        Choose the
                        most effective workflow for the mission, and Ranger will have your back.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our approach to autonomous design <strong>minimises risk</strong>. With redundant systems,
                        intelligent
                        failsafes and real-time monitoring of essential systems, Ranger assesses its health
                        constantly, and is capable of autonomous return and landing, even without a <span

                        record logs,
                        allowing for detailed data analysis during debriefs.</p>

                    <p>Ranger's construction will prioritise <strong>ease of assembly, lightness, and strength</strong>.
                        We aim to
                        produce components using innovative manufacturing techniques, keeping costs low while
                        improving structural integrity. <strong>3D printing and modern composites</strong> will play a
                        key role in
                        Ranger's design. Rapid deployment can save lives - that's why we aim to <strong>remove
                            hassle</strong>
                        from setup by keeping Ranger as <strong>light and compact</strong> as possible. Our unique
                        airframe*
                        allows for a highly optimised carry case, minimising volume and maximising portability where
                        it matters most. A fixed wing design improves longevity and performance over traditional
                        quadcopters</p>
                    <p><small>* Ranger is in rapid development, and its final design is subject to change. A tandem wing
                            design is being
                            explored in order to simplify setup and transportation and improve handling.</small></p>

                <div id="powerplant" class="tabcontent">
                    <p>The heart of a UAV is its powerplant; motors and batteries. For years, commercially-available
                        drones have lagged behind security/military-based counterparts, with underpowered
                        systems and poor range. Ranger will do better. Two variants are in development: a
                        <strong>traditional medium-range battery-driven system</strong>, and an <strong>innovative
                            long-range hybrid
                            powerplant</strong>, combining gasoline power generation with batteries. Both variants will
                        power
                        the same VTOL motors; dedicated vertical-flight motors allow for balance and smooth
                        transition between VTOL and cruise missions. The ability to stay out for longer than
                        contemporary designs will provide a generational leap to long-loiter missions. Ranger will
                        stay watching, however long you need it.
