                        envisioned as a pentamotor, tandem-wing

                        capabilities, featuring full autonomous
                        control and an inbuilt compute module.</p>
                    <p>Working in tandem with <span class="orange">Ground Station</span>
                        and <span class="orange">Connect</span>, Ranger will operate as
