            <div>
                <p>Our system provides a complex
                    datastream and it requires a
                    bespoke, portable network.
                    Ground Station is our solution,
                    providing the networking support
                    needed for a team to use
                    Ranger to its full potential.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Working in tandem with Connect, the Local
                    Area Network provided by Ground Station
                    provides an unparalleled connectivity between
                    team members. With every connected member
                    able to see what Ranger's operator sees, it is
                    easier than ever to coordinate on the fly. WiFi 6
                    brings rapid connection speeds and high range,
                    allowing distant users to access Ground
                    Station's data without issue.</p>
                <p>With the potential for each Ranger to talk to
                    multiple Stations, Wide Area Networking allows
                    for a breakthrough in ease of operations -
                    unprecedented data sharing across a great
                    distance.</p>

                <h1>Durable Design</h1>
                <p>Hardened against rainfall and rockfall,
                    Ground Station goes anywhere your team
                    can. Built to IP55 specifications, our water
                    and dust-resistant device is designed to
                    withstand demanding outdoor
                    environments. Integrated strap points
                    allow you to mount Ground Station
                    to a backpack... </p>
                <p>and forget about it.</p>

                <h1>Redundant Connectivity</h1>
                <p>Ensuring safety and minimising risk, Ground
                    Station has redundancy measures built-in. A
                    double radio link to Ranger allows for constant
                    communication between networked ground
                    and air systems. Mitigating software design
                    integrates failsafes on both sides of the
                    connection. A poor signal doesn't mean risking
                    the drone or the mission.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Real-time Health Monitoring</h1>
                <p>Building upon the diagnostics built into the
                    drone itself, Ground Station will constantly
                    cross-check Ranger's data for any issues while
                    monitoring its own uplink. Alerting you
                    directly on Ground Station's LCD screen, or via
                    Connect, it keeps your team in the loop. With
                    Ground Station's monitoring, you'll never miss a
                    problem.</p>

            <div>
                <p>An intelligent network is nothing
                    without longevity. Ground Station will
                    be powered by waterproofed,
                    rechargeable battery packs, offering up
                    to 10 hours of connectivity on a single
                    charge. Designed to the same durability
                    as the Station itself, and with USB-C
                    support to allow quick and simple
                    charging, each pack brings the power
                    you need to keep your team
                    connected.</p>
